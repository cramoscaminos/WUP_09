```{r include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
require(tigerstats)
require(tidyverse)

Fish = read.csv("Fish.csv")
Perch = filter(Fish, Species == "Perch")
Pike = filter(Fish, Species == "Pike")
Roach = filter(Fish, Species == "Roach")
```

# Predicting Fish Weight
```{r}

pwt = lm(Weight~ Length1+ Length2+ Length3+ Height, data =  Perch)
summary(pwt)
```
From this graph I conclude that the best two predictors of weight for Perch are Height and length3.
